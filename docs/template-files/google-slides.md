**Tips for using presentation templates**

* When you click on a template in the presentation gallery, it automatically generates your own copy of the deck.  
* Rename it with your presentation title, and move it to an appropriate folder in Google Drive.  
* To see all possible slide layouts for building your deck, navigate to “Slide > Apply Layout” inside the presentation builder.
