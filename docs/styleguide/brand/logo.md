# Logo
The primary CivicActions logo (preferred for most use cases) is the full-length wordmark in red. You can download it here:

There is also a shorter, truncated version of the logo using the abbreviation “CA”. This is used only when space limitations make it necessary (e.g., social media profile avatars). 

Both variations of the logo are available in RGB for digital use and CMYK for print use. 

Each variation is available in these colors:

* Red: Red 50 - #D83933 (Primary Red)  
* Light: Gray Warm 4 - #F5F5F0 (Off-White)  
* Dark: Gray 90 - #1B1B1B (Off-Black)  
* Black: #000000  
* White: #ffffff

The print (CMYK) version of the logo is also available in Rich Black (60, 40, 40, 100). This is only to be used for print.

## Logo usage  
The CivicActions logo represents our company and brand. It should only be used in ways consistent with this guide. If you have a question about logo usage, ask someone in [#brand](https://app.slack.com/client/T0297RSQF/CEFGEMP4L).

**Spacing requirements**  
The spacing around the CivicActions logos should be dictated based on the height of the lower case c. The padding around the logo should equal the width of the lower case c of the full logo. This helps set the logo apart from other elements on the page.

## Favicon
The favicon (sometimes called a web icon, tab icon, or URL file) is the file of small icons associated with a website. You see it in an open browser tab.

For CivicActions’ favicon, the SVG file has a media query that enables the logo to automatically switch color if the user is using dark mode. This is the preferred file to use, so the logo is clearly visible to the greatest number of people.

[Favicon SVG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_spug0_4djx0wfAY7Ew97CmNd6GIe7g/view?usp=sharing) (preferred)

There are also two ICO files (light and red) that can be used.

All of these are located in this [favicon folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_spug0_4djx0wfAY7Ew97CmNd6GIe7g/view?usp=sharing).
