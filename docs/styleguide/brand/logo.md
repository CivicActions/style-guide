# Proper use guidance
### Why logo usage matters 
The CivicActions logo is a key part of our brand. Our logo helps others recognize CivicActions presence in our work, partnerships, and relationships in the community. To state the obvious, the logo represents CivicActions, so it’s important to use it with intention and care. 

These guidelines will help you use the CivicActions logo in a way that’s consistent with our visual brand. Whether you’re using it for a critical presentation with a client, or more casual internal purposes, our visual presence matters, so please be mindful of how you represent CivicActions.

### What counts as a CivicActions logo? 
The CivicActions mark includes the CivicActions logotype (full name: “CivicActions”) as well as the truncated logo (abbreviated: “CA”). 

### Be mindful of context
Where our logo appears is just as important as how it appears. Avoid using the logo in ways that imply sponsorship or endorsement, unless that is the intent. 

**Yes**

Putting CivicActions logo on the Code for America Summit site to indicate sponsorship..

**No**

Including our logo on public documents that don’t represent our work. Placing our logo next to the logo of another company with whom we don’t have a partnership.

Additionally, do not modify either logo in a way that confuses CivicActions with another brand or organization. 

**No**

Placing the truncated logo (CA) in a context where it would be confused with the state of California.

### Approved versions of the CivicActions logo
Whenever possible, default to using our primary logo: a red CivicActions logotype on white background. There are many instances where the primary logo may not be the best representation of the brand, such as when applying the logo to a red background. In these cases, there are a handful of approved variations available.

## Sizing

## Padding

The spacing around the CivicActions logos should be dictated based on the height. A good measure listed below is to have the padding equal to about half the height of the full logo. This should isolate the logo in a way that allows it to not get confused with other elements or copy on the page.
