# Logo
The primary CivicActions logo (preferred for most use cases) is the full-length wordmark in red. You can download it here:

PNG - 1292x204

There is also a shorter, truncated version of the logo using the abbreviation “CA”. This is used only when space limitations make it necessary (e.g., social media profile avatars). 

Both variations of the logo are available in RGB for digital use and CMYK for print use. 

Each variation is available in these colors:

* Red: Red 50 - #D83933 (Primary Red)  
* Light: Gray Warm 4 - #F5F5F0 (Off-White)  
* Dark: Gray 90 - #1B1B1B (Off-Black)  
* Black: #000000  
* White: #ffffff

The print (CMYK) version of the logo is also available in Rich Black (60, 40, 40, 100). This is only to be used for print.
