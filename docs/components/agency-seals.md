Agency seals of our clients are another visual element found on our homesite and some marketing materials. We use these to demonstrate our experience and the impact of our work with agencies that serve the public.

Some examples of agency seals usage are found in:

**Rules for using agency seals**  
We use grayscale for agency logos on the website to avoid too much color and busy-ness on the page. The color indicated provides an acceptable amount of contrast.

Color: gray-50 - #757575

However, agency seals may also be used full-color in some applications. Ask a designer or someone in [#brand](https://app.slack.com/client/T0297RSQF/CEFGEMP4L) if you are unsure what to use.
